Our knowledge of the contribution of genetic interactions (epistasis) to variation in human complex traits remains limited, partly due to the lack of efficient, powerful, and interpretable algorithms to detect interactions. Recently proposed approaches for set-based association tests show promise in improving power to detect epistasis by examining the aggregated effects of multiple variants. Nevertheless, these methods either do not scale to large numbers of individuals available in Biobank datasets or do not provide interpretable results. We, therefore, propose QuadKAST, a scalable algorithm focused on testing pairwise interaction effects (also termed as quadratic effects) of a set of genetic variants on a trait and quantifying the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by these effects.
