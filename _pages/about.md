Hello! My name is Aakarsh, and I'm a CS PhD student at UCLA. I'm broadly interested in large-scale machine learning and statistical modeling for high-dimensional data. Currently, I am working on applications of AI/ML in biomedical data, particularly to understand the genetic architecture of complex human traits and diseases. I have recently published in Genome Research and RECOMB 2024.
