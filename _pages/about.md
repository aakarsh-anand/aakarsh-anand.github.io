Hello! My name is Aakarsh, and I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at UCLA. I'm broadly interested in large-scale machine learning and statistical modeling for high-dimensional data. Currently, I am working on applications of AI/ML in biomedical data, particularly developing novel representation learning methods for unlabeled multimodal data to apply to challenging prediction problems. I am also interested in developing methods to understand the genetic architecture of complex human traits and diseases. I have recently published in [Genome Research](https://genome.cshlp.org/) and [RECOMB 2024](https://recomb.org/recomb2024/). Feel free to send an email if you would like to chat!

Outside of research, I am highly connected to the arts. I have played the piano and french horn for many years and have been active in bands and orchestras in college as well. Recently, I've started dancing some hip-hop on a few teams and I also love to create art using various media! Check out some of my work [here](https://aakarsh-anand.github.io/hobbies/).

Interests
======
I am mainly focused on Artificial Intelligence with additional directions in Data Science Computing and Computational Systems Biology. More specific interests include:
- Machine learning
